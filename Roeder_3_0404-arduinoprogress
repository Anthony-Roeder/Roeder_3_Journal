We have finally decided on something like a piano.

We are working on where the wires should be going.

What we need to do is decide where the buttons and sound buzzer should go.

I do not believe that we will finish by friday.

Add if statement for when the buttons pushed.

We haven't created anything yet but we are certain that the final project will be great.

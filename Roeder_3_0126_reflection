I continuously worked on my game throughout the week without fail but, still I barely made the deadline.

My trouble shooting was probably my worst process to go through because I kept having to check if the game still was able to function. But thanks to the help of classmates
and Mr.Davis I was able to fix most of the trouble shoots without wasting precious time.

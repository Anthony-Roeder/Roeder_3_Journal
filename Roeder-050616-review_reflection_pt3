    Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
    Consider:

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
The coordinates for the X are 67 and the Y is 42 if the first column is 0.            
          

    Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
 if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); 
This code is telling the computer to put the numbers 8888 if the x coordinate is eqauk to 0.
    Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
System.out.print(map[i][j]);
THis code is saying to print the 67x43 make using the dots for each coordinate point.
    Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
System.out.println("."); #c
This code prints the dots for the 2-D Array but unlike #c, #e doesn't have the line print. 
    Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
This code is just saying if none of the methods above it are availble just draw the map.
    Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
  while(!answer){
         move = whichway.nextLine().toLowerCase();
         if(move.contains("9")) {
         Hero.x--;
         Hero.y++;
         answer=true;
THis code repeats the use of the Scanner so the player can answer over and over. As well as print the map over and over.
    Explain the use of static.
Using static allows for other classes to use variables from different classes. 
    Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
By creating the player/ Hero.
public class Hero {
   static int x = 19;
   static int y = 19;
   static int health = 100;
    char symbol ='@';
}
public class Game{
Hero hero = new Hero;

}

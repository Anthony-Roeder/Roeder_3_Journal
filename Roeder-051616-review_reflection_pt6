Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting allows the change of a datatypes to better suit the codes needs.
Up-casting is changing code into something more specific and giving more info.
Downcasting is just the opposite which is being less specific which is asking for more info.

Give a specific code example for up-casting
  Mammal m = (Mammal)new Cat();
Give a specific code example for down-casting
 Cat c1 = new Cat();		 
	Animal a = c1;		 //automatic upcasting to Animal
	Cat c2 = (Cat) a;    //manual downcasting back to a Cat
Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
char charVal = X;
String StringVal = (String)charVal;

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127 or 0 to 255 because the byte can run 8-bit but that is the max value
which is why there are other datatypes with higher values.

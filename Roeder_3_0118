I created a dungeon crawler type slick game.

Some challenges I solved was the speed of the player as I added enemies.

I did not because I was already finished with my map and spritesheets before the break.

I wasable to meet the timeline but only jkust barely, but if I would have focused more instead of goof around I would have finished it sooner.

Arduino uses a variant of the C programming language.

What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
Some things I noticed that are the same are that most of the code is similar in the ways they're used.
However, the arduino doesn't used the package and start code like the C programming language.

What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
We have took snip its from the other examples and altered them so all the code could run together.

What is required for a circuit?
Mostly the wires and buzzer, but mainly the cord that connects to the red board and to the computer.

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
They are just given actions to do and they are done with things like booleans and the main classes.

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them. Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.
What I learned from all the projects is that there is a HUGE room
for error because even the slightest mistake in the code or the wiring
for the Red Board the project will not function correctly.

You will be completing your own project - a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.

Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make. [Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided - using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
Some code adaptation that will have to be made are frequncies settings for the buzzer example so my partner and I can make a piano.

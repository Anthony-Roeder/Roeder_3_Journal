I have made plenty of progress so far the only pronlem I'm having is with the
graphics context. Right now I'm trying to male a radial gradient but I was
 expiriencing some minor difficulties. I've made so far a linear
 gradient and The letter D with multiple colors but one i finish with the
 graphic contexts i'll be able to tweak my work to make it even better.

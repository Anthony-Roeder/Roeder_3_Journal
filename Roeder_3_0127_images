I added images to my games by creating a class the writing a for loop to make them visible such as...
	for (Item1 i : stuff) {
			if (i.isvisible) {
				i.currentImage.draw(i.x, i.y);
	}
}

The image is drawn here using this ArrayList and method.

public ArrayList<Item1> stuff = new ArrayList();

 healthpotion = new Item1(100, 100);
		healthpotion1 = new Item1(450, 400);

How do I add more levels?

We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?

How do I add more levels?

We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?

Pay attention to the directions given or ask my neighbors for assistance before I ask the teacher.

Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? 

I don't believe I'm ready because I'm still having a bit of trouble with arrays and setting up the new classes.

If not be specific.

My plans for the art project is to build some sort of environment if possible.

I will have to is multiple shape methods for the environment.

I will use a for loop for a landscape size.

I will use multiple if, else if statements for the different viberant colors for the shapes.

I might have to use graphing so i can put the shapes in the proper place.

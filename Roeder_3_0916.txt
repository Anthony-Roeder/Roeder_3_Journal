The three guiding rules/principles for this class are..

1)Be sure to tinker
2)Keep electronics put away
3)Interact with students if you need assistance or have questions


Why...

If a student were to encounter a problem first he or she should begin to tinker with the code to see if you can solve the problem yourself.
Next if the problem still isn't solved ask a neighbor if they can solve the problem.
Finally as a last resort ask the teacher for assistance and finally solve the problem.

The motavition for the process is to try and solvew the problem yourself first before asking for help.

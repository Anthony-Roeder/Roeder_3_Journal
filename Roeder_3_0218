This code loads the sprite sheet and tells the program where to look for the frames of the animation when the player is running up.
This code loads the sprite sheet and tells the program where to look for the frames of the animation when the player is running up.
Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This code initializes the up movement of the spritesheet by telling the program where to look for the animation.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?

It would be pointless to memorize slick syntax because it's a very specific code that gives you directions but we want to practice not just memorize.

What is an array?

It is a list of ordered items/objects. 

How do you make an array? Give an example.

int [] ar = new int[];

What is an ArrayList?

An ArrayList is resizeable array that can hold different object types.

How do you make an arraylist?

ArrayList <boolean> Enemy = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?

An array is something that can't be resized (Static) but an ArrayList can(Dynamic).

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?

int hp = 100;

hp --;

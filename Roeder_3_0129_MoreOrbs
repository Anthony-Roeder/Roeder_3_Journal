A class constructor is used to create a new class with variables that you set before you instantiate the class.

For the Orbs the height and width are a must and if you want them to do damage then a damage variable as well. You may also add a speed variable to control how fast the orb will go.

Some methods you should use for the orbs are damage methods, speed methods and a method that makes the orb disappear when it intersects a hitbox of an enemy or player.

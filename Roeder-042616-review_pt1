 Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

public int cubed(int input) {
int squared = input*input;
int cubed = input*squared;

return cubed;
}
 Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.

void setup(){
}
void loop(){
	cube(3);
}
int cube(int num){
	int square;
	int cube;
	square = num*num;
	cubed = num*square;
	return cube;
}

 Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student
public class CSstars() {
	int grade;
	int rank;
	public students(int a, int b) {
	this.grade = a;
	this.rank = b;
}


 Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

I would like to create some sort of game like mechanism with the buttons and sign thing.
For example something like BopIt where the player must find the button the light is connected to.
Or give them a challenge to find a certain light color using the buttons in a certain amount of time.

I'd would say I'm a mix between the ones who had no recollection and the ones who knew because I was clueless until
the day before the assignment was due til I actually realized that the code was extremely simalar to the slick games.

Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. 
E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

1.Which code would correctly display a 2-D Array?
2.How would you make a while loop?
3.How would you use booleans in an array game?
4.Explain how you would instantiate a new class?
5.How do you create a 2-D array?
6.How would you create a 3-D array?
7.How would you allow the values of other classes be allowed to be used in the main class.
8.Which code would print out...?
9.How would you use an arraylist in your game?
10.Explain what you would use in other games like this? Why?

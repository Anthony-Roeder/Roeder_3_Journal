Some challenges I've encountered during the slick game is time consumption because you only have a certain amount of time to create one thing til you start falling behind.

I'm trying to create a 2-D maze crawler where you must find the exit and defeat enemies along the way.

Some challenges I'm facing are all the new coding bits I must memorize so I can create a good quality game.
